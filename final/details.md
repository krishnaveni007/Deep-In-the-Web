This announcement is regarding the project final report, which is due Wed, Dec 11. Here are some guidelines for the final report.

Please read through the feedback on the midterm report and feel free to stop by during office hours if you want to discuss. Please pay attention to the concerns, especially if there are major ones. Not addressing the major concerns will lead to further low scores.

The final report is max 6 pages + references, using at least 11-pt font and 1 inch margins. You can optionally add appendices, but the main report has to be 6 pages. Having figures and tables with good captions and readable font sizes in the final report helps make the report stronger. The material in the Appendix has to be optional for the reader -- making it necessary to look at the Appendix leads to a violation of the page limit and there will be a penalty for that.

The final report has to be self-contained. Even if you have discussed aspects in your earlier reports, the final report should present the complete story, without relying on earlier reports.

Structure of the final report -- you want to cover the following material, ideally following these as section structure (recommended) or otherwise covering the material in some form:

   1. Title, starting with group id, please also include names of group members

   2. Abstract, summarizing the project 

   3. Introduction, a self-contained intro to the problem, including a brief motivation (why the problem is interesting/important, etc.)

   4. Motivation: A few sentences on why the project is of interest from a data mining and/or real world application perspective.

   5. Related work, in the literature, and in Kaggle/related forum. Having just 1-2 references, only references to Kaggle, or no references to peer reviewed papers/books will lead to low scores. 

   6. Methodology - what has been done from a data mining perspective. This can include any exploratory or statistical data analysis, visualization, efficient data storage/compression, pattern mining, fitting predictive models, deep learning, clustering, etc.  If you have done a comparative study involving different methods, discuss the methods you have considered, include any methods being used as baselines.   As much as possible, justify the steps, so it is clear how the pieces fit towards a bigger goal (the project).   You have to highlight alignment with the course clearly, especially if you have received feedback on concerns regarding limited alignment with the course. 

   7. Empirical results -- What are key questions being investigated as part of the empirical study, what are the results, and what are the key take-aways. The presentation of the results have to be self-contained. Please clearly discuss the evaluation setup, including train/validation/test splits, evaluation measures, hyperparameter tuning, and related aspects.  Please use clear well-written captions for Figures and Tables, so they can be read and understood. Figures/tables with limited or no captions will be penalized. Some figures in the progress report had too small fonts on the figure labels/legends -- please avoid this, we will disregard figures with unreadable small fonts, and you will lose points on these.

   8. Conclusion / discussions  -- a summary of the project, concluding remarks, and brief outlook, possibly including directions for future work.

The final report has to be submitted through canvas. Only one submission per group is fine, all group members will receive the same score.
