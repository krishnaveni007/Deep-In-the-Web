  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Problematic internet use (PIU) is an increasingly
               worrisome issue, as youth population studies are establishing
               links with internalizing and externalizing problems. There is a
               need for a better understanding of psychiatric diagnostic
               profiles associated with this issue, as well as its unique
               contributions to impairment. Here, we leveraged the ongoing,
               large-scale Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network, a
               transdiagnostic self-referred, community sample of children and
               adolescents (ages 5-21), to examine the associations between PIU
               and psychopathology, general impairment, physical health and
               sleep disturbances. METHODS: A total sample of 564 (190 female)
               participants between the ages of 7-15 (mean = 10.80, SD = 2.16),
               along with their parents/guardians, completed diagnostic
               interviews with clinicians, answered a wide range of self-report
               (SR) and parent-report (PR) questionnaires, including the
               Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and underwent physical testing as
               part of the Healthy Brain Network protocol. RESULTS: PIU was
               positively associated with depressive disorders (SR: aOR = 2.43,
               CI: 1.22-4.74, p = .01; PR: aOR = 2.56, CI: 1.31-5.05, p = .01),
               the combined presentation of ADHD (SR: aOR = 1.91, CI:
               1.14-3.22, p = .01; PR: n.s.), Autism Spectrum Disorder (SR:
               n.s.; PR: aOR = 2.24, CI: 1.34-3.73, p < .001), greater levels
               of impairment (SR: Standardized Beta = 4.63, CI: 3.06-6.20, p <
               .001; PR: Standardized Beta = 5.05, CI: 3.67-6.42, p < .001) and
               increased sleep disturbances (SR: Standardized Beta = 3.15, CI:
               0.71-5.59, p = .01; PR: Standardized Beta = 3.55, CI: 1.34-5.75,
               p < .001), even when accounting for demographic covariates and
               psychiatric comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The association between
               PIU and psychopathology, as well as its impact on impairment and
               sleep disturbances, highlight the urgent need to gain an
               understanding of mechanisms in order to inform public health
               recommendations on internet use in U.S. youth.",

  abstract  = "There is wide agreement that the Internet can serve as a tool
               that enhances well-being. It is more difficult, however, to find
               consensus around the issue of problematic Internet use. That may
               be in part because scientific investigation has lagged far
               behind technological advances and media attention. The
               diagnostic schemas that have been proposed since 1996, and the
               screening tools that have been developed, stress similarities
               with substance use, impulse control disorders, and
               obsessive-compulsive disorder. Prevalence figures vary as a
               function of the diagnostic definition used, the age group
               studied, and whether the surveys were conducted online. Studies
               suggest high comorbidity rates with mood disorders and, among
               younger individuals, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
               Treatment should address any comorbid conditions present, as
               those may be causing, or exacerbating, problematic Internet use.
               Interventions that may specifically target problematic Internet
               use include cognitive behavioral therapy and selective serotonin
               reuptake inhibitors, but detailed guidelines must await further
               studies. For a medium that has so radically changed how we
               conduct our lives, the Internet's effects on our psychology
               remain understudied. More research is needed into the
               pathophysiology, epidemiology, natural course, and treatment of
               problematic Internet use. In addition, the more subtle
               psychological changes, such as disinhibition, that seem to
               characterize people's online behavior also deserve attention,
               even if they cannot be seen as necessarily pathological.",

               lives by causing neurological complications, psychological
               disturbances, and social problems. Surveys in the United States
               and Europe have indicated alarming prevalence rates between 1.5

               risk factors related to PIU remain still unclear. In the present
               study we explored the role of personality traits and emotion
               dysregulation as potential vulnerability factors for PIU. In a
               sample of American young adults with different PIU risk levels
               (established through the Internet Addiction Diagnostic
               Questionnaire), we administered the Tridimensional Personality
               Questionnaire (TPQ), the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation
               Scale (DERS), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, the Hamilton
               Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. PIU
               participants were more likely to report lower TPQ scores in
               novelty seeking, harm avoidance and reward dependence. Moreover,
               DERS total scores significantly differed across PIU-risk groups,
               along with a progressively higher occurrence of depression,
               anxiety and impulsivity. These results preliminarily support the
               hypothesis of PIU as a mainly behavior aimed at 'escaping' from
               negative affects. Besides confirming the role of some
               personality traits and emotional dysregulation, we propose the
               concept of risk-trajectories to monitor and prevent the
               emergence of PIU. Gaining more insight into PIU vulnerability
               factors may allow us to establish targeted interventions to cope
               with emotion dysregulation and negative affects.",
