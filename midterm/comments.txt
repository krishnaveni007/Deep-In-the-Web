1) Summary:

The project is going to create a ML model to predict Problematic Internet Use(PIU) in children and teens. They will be participating in a corresponding Kaggle competition. 

2) Strength and weaknesses:

Strength:
+ Overall the project is exciting and can have impact
+ Demonstrated full understanding of the problem and the dataset. The project has clear goals.
+ Great plan on data preprocessing

Weaknesses:
RESOLVED - From the Kaggle competition website, it said "The majority of measures are missing for most participants. In particular, the target sii is missing for a portion of the participants in the training set." How are you going to resolve this issue?
RESOLVED - Unclear validation plan -- how will you evaluate your model beyond submitting to Kaggle directly for the review? Note that this has to be done to assess performance before such a submission. 


3) Datasets and Validation Plan
RESOLVED - Did not specify the evaluation metric that they are going to use
RESOLVED - How are you going to create a validation set? (Train-validation-test splits, Cross-Validation, etc.)


4) Alignment with material covered in course:

The project is aligned with material covered in course.


5) Size and scope:
Size and scope is suitable for a 3-person project over a 2 month period.
